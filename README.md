# VAE-Protein-Sequence-Function
We are looking at Variational AutoEncoders for Protein Sequence-Function data

#### Papers/Resources
We are mainly following the following paper
[Variational auto-encoding of protein sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03346)
Sinai, Sam; Kelsic, Eric; Church, George M.; Nowak, Martin A.

This Youtube video also gives an overview of the big picture
